#### What do you think of pre-compiling your CSS?

* Compared to regular CSS the pre-compilerg CSS has a more similar syntax to other programming languages.  

  That make it feel familiar then learning but a bit harder. 
  It also has the benefits of being able to group code so it can be reused on the page such as with Mixins. For exapel with Mixins.

* I used SCSS on my webbsite because it came with Jekyll and was the rekomended pre-compiler for the corse.

* Benefits of using pre compiler is that it is possible to reuse code. So that you do not need to repeat code that is often used on the site.  

  Disadvantages are that it is more difficult to learn. And if someone comes and works on the site that is not familiar with pre compiler and changes directly in the CSS. Would have his work overwritten.

* I think that static site generators are very useful. This was the first time that I came in contact with a static site generator. and that          together with the themes, you can with limited knowledge build nice and reasonably complicated websites. 

  Static site generator are most suitable for simpler web pages that do not have dynamic content such as information pages or a smaller sports club. 

* Robot.txt is a text file that instruct the search engines robots "Spiders" what pages on the website it can index and use in search result.  

  I've configured it to stop all search engine robots from indexing my pages.

* Humans.txt is a text file the has information about the persons that has created the website. It can also contain special thanks and software       that was used on the site and when the site where last updated.

  I've configured it with my name, email, location , last updated and software.

*  I used Disqus on my website because it was the recommended examination requirements. And because it was implemented in the Minima theme the         configuration were easy.

* Open Graph is a protocol that help share on social media to display extra information about the web page under the URl.

  I still working on the open graf
